<summary> About Me</summary>
<br>
I am a meticulous and detail-oriented full stack software engineer experienced in JavaScript, Node, React, and MongoDB. With my experience in the criminal justice industry, I have discovered the lack of quality tracking applications for this data heavy industry. This led me to my current path and passion to create software for agencies that have fallen behind in the new tech based world. As a freelance agent, I have provided clients with a user-friendly interface for their business using IavaScript, React, Node.js, and Mongo DB. I love to solve problems by programming. I am looking for join a company with a global reach and provide my skills and follow my interest in helping businesses update their systems.
